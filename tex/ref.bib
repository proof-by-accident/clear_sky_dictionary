Increasingly high penetration level of photovoltaic (PV) generation arises in smart grid.

The inherent variability of large-scale solar generation introduces significant challenges to smart grid energy management.

The difference, rather than the ratio, between pixel RBR and CSL RBR resulted in more accurate cloud classification. High correlation between TSI image RBR and aerosol optical depth (AOD) measured by an AERONET photometer was observed and motivated the addition of a haze correction factor (HCF) to the classification model to account for variations in AOD. Thresholds for clear and thick clouds were chosen based on a training image set and validated with set of manually annotated images. Misclassifications of clear and thick clouds into the opposite category were less than 1\%. Thin clouds were classified with an accuracy of 60\%.

As PV energy continues to penetrate the U.S. National Energy Grid, such volatility increasingly lowers its reliability, eﬃciency, and value-added contribution. Therefore a model that can accurately predict the cloud motion and its affect on PV system’s production is in a pressing demands. It can be used to mitigate the undesired behavior beforehand. In this paper we explore the use of Total Sky Images and the cloud estimation techniques based on such images. To further improve estimation quality of motion vector, we propose a novel hybrid algorithm taking the advantages of both correlation based and local feature based approaches. Our proposed hybrid approach signiﬁcantly reduces the cloud motion prediction error rate by 25\% on average, which can help to predict short term solar energy frustration in our later work.},

Limited validation on four partly cloudy days showed that (binary) cloud conditions were correctly nowcast 70\% of the time for a network of six pyranometer ground stations spread out over an area of 2km2. Cloud motion vectors were generated by cross-correlating two consecutive sky images. Cloud locations up to 5min ahead were forecasted by advection of the two-dimensional cloud map.

We consider three different cloud motion algorithms: heuristic motion detection (HMD), particle image velocimetry (PIV), and a persistent model. The HMD method is originally proposed in this paper. It consists in choosing the cloud motion vector leading to the best cloud map prediction considering the most recent sky images. Results show that integrating the information of the predicted cloud coverage in the circumsolar area leads to a decrease of the width of the GHI prediction intervals up to 2\% for prediction horizons in the range 1 to 10 minutes.},

This clear sky library is typically created by visually scrutinizing daily sky videos and selecting appropriate clear sky periods. This practice takes a significant amount of time and manual intervention can result in human errors. To avoid this, an automated CSL algorithm (ACSL) was developed which filters each image for clear sky features including maximum green pixel brightness, average RBR, and red channel difference by pixel with respect to the previous image. The root mean square difference (RMSD) between the image RBR of the manually created CSL and the ACSL for November and April 2013 at UC San Diego were observed to be less than 6\% over the full range of solar zenith angles. The ACSL was found to be more representative of clear conditions than its manual counterpart.},

In the past, traditional two-dimensional red-to-blue band methods have been widely used for cloud detection in total-sky images. By analyzing the imaging principle of cameras, the green channel has been selected to replace the 2-D red-to-blue band for detecting cloud pixels from partly cloudy total-sky images in this study. The brightness distribution in a total-sky image is usually nonuniform, because of forward scattering and Mie scattering of aerosols, which results in increased detection errors in the circumsolar and near-horizon regions. This paper proposes an automatic cloud detection algorithm, "green channel background subtraction adaptive threshold" (GBSAT), which incorporates channel selection, background simulation, computation of solar mask and cloud mask, subtraction, an adaptive threshold, and binarization. Five experimental cases show that the GBSAT algorithm produces more accurate retrieval results for all these test total-sky images.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The information on the pixel contamination by clouds was obtained from the saturation component of the intensity, hue, and saturation space (IHS). For simplicity, the images were acquired with a limited field of view of 36° pointing to the camera’s zenith to prevent direct sunlight from reaching the internal charge-coupled device (CCD) on the camera. For a priori–classified clear-sky images, the accuracy of the method was superior to 94\%. For overcast-sky conditions, the corresponding accuracy was larger than 99\%. A comparison test was performed with two human observers and our method. The results for the 29 images collected for several time of days during 50 days in 1999 summer were compared to visual observations of these same digital images by two trained field meteorologists. Correlation coefficients between human observers and the automatic method ranged from 0.84 for clear-sky conditions, and the lowest was 0.09 for undefined-sky conditions.},

	abstract = {Enabling deep penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) requires comprehensive monitoring and control of the distribution network. Increasing observability beyond the substation and extending it to the edge of the grid is required to achieve this goal. The growing availability of data from measurements from inverters, smart meters, EV chargers, smart thermostats and other devices provides an opportunity to address this problem. Integration of these new data poses many challenges since not all devices are connected to the traditional supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks and can be novel types of information, collected at various sampling rates and with potentially missing values. Visualization and analytics for distributed energy resources (VADER) system and workﬂow is introduced as an approach and platform to fuse these different streams of data from utilities and third parties to enable comprehensive situational awareness, including scenario analysis and system state estimation. The system leverages modern large scale computing platforms, machine learning and data analytics and can be used alongside traditional advanced distribution management system (ADMS) systems to provide improved insights for distribution system management in the presence of DERs.},

	abstract = {Solar irradiance forecast accuracy of a ground-based sky imaging system currently being developed at UC San Diego is analyzed by assessing its performance on thirty-one consecutive days of historical data collected during winter. Sky images were taken every 30s, and then processed to determine cloud cover, optical depth (thick or thin), and mean cloud field velocity. Cloud locations were forecasted using a frozen cloud advection method at 30s intervals up to a forecast horizon of 15min. During the analysis period, cloud field matching errors, which monotonically increase as a function of forecast horizon, did not exceed 30\% over the sky imager’s field-of-view. On average, frozen cloud advection forecasts were found to perform superiorly to image persistence forecasts for all forecast horizons during the analysis period. Six (later eleven) distributed pyranometer installations over the UCSD campus provided 1-s instantaneous GHI measurements with which to validate irradiance forecasts. Excluding clear days or days with small forecast sample size, sky imager irradiance forecasts were found to perform the same as or better than clear sky index (clear-sky normalized GHI) persistence forecasts on 4 out of 24days for 5-min forecasts, 8 out of 23days for 10-min forecasts, and 11 out of 23days for 15-min forecasts. Furthermore, visual comparison of forecast irradiance with measured irradiance revealed the ability to accurately predict cloud-induced irradiance fluctuations, which persistence forecasts cannot offer. An additional month of data collected during summer was analyzed to evaluate performance consistency during a time period with different meteorological conditions. Due to sky conditions favoring persistence forecast and challenges with cloud detection, sky imager forecasts were unable to surpass persistence forecasts for all 32days for 5-min forecasts and only succeeded on 1day for 10-min forecasts. However, bulk errors indicated consistency with winter forecasts, with rRMSE of 24.3\% (20.0\% for winter) and 27.7\% (22.9\%) for 5- and 10-min forecasts, respectively. A discussion of the challenges and sources of error applicable to the sky imaging system used is also presented, as well as future research intended to address potential areas of improvement.},

CSP (Concentrated solar power) and PV (photovoltaic) plants are the systems most in demand for electricity production using solar radiation as the energy source. The main factors affecting final electricity generation in these plants are, among others, atmospheric conditions; therefore, knowing whether there will be any change in the solar radiation hitting the plant's solar field is of fundamental importance to CSP and PV plant operators in adapting the plant's operation mode to these fluctuations. Consequently, the most useful technology must involve the study of atmospheric conditions. This is the case for sky cameras, an emerging technology that allows one to gather sky information with optimal spatial and temporal resolution. Hence, in this work, a solar radiation estimation using sky camera images is presented for all sky conditions, where beam, diffuse and global solar radiation components are estimated in real-time as a novel way to evaluate the solar resource from a terrestrial viewpoint.},

In the past, traditional two-dimensional red-to-blue band methods have been widely used for cloud detection in total-sky images. By analyzing the imaging principle of cameras, the green channel has been selected to replace the 2-D red-to-blue band for detecting cloud pixels from partly cloudy total-sky images in this study. The brightness distribution in a total-sky image is usually nonuniform, because of forward scattering and Mie scattering of aerosols, which results in increased detection errors in the circumsolar and near-horizon regions. This paper proposes an automatic cloud detection algorithm, "green channel background subtraction adaptive threshold" (GBSAT), which incorporates channel selection, background simulation, computation of solar mask and cloud mask, subtraction, an adaptive threshold, and binarization. Five experimental cases show that the GBSAT algorithm produces more accurate retrieval results for all these test total-sky images.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Cloud motion vectors are retrieved at a subset of points through multiple applications of a cross-correlation analysis. An area in the first of two sequential frames of satellite data is correlated with surrounding areas in the second frame to find the one surrounding area best correlated. The location difference of the areas defines the displacement vector. An objective analysis is used to define displacements at every satellite pixel throughout the domain and smooth the local inconsistencies. Using these displacements, forecasts are then produced with a backward trajectory technique. This scheme was tested using two IR satellite images of the same scene a half-hour apart and found to generate realistic, high-quality forecast IR pixel images. Results demonstrate improvements over persistence and movable persistence for forecasts of a few hours’ length. The technique is visually appealing, since forecasts are created in pixel images of the same form and resolution as the initializing satellite data, permitting animation. It is also computationally inexpensive.},
